    <p>My objective is to aid people in the use of technology. I am also looking forward to working in the video game industry. I bring fundamental knowledge of technology, passion, and problem solving to a suitable work environment. I hope to find a job that allows me to challenge myself and learn everyday in a positive environment filled with respectable, talented and hardworking peers that I appreciate and that appreciate the effort that I bring.</p>
